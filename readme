This project has been made during my dev training (MongoDB / Express / Node).

I created the whole [./backend] folder.

To run the app locally, please follow these instructions :

- Create a MongoDB database and make sure you have admin access
- Clone the repository

- Copy/paste the [./backend/.env.example] file
- Rename the newly created `.env copy.example` file to `.env`
- Insert your MongoDB connection string into the `.env` file (don't forget to include your password)
- From the [./backend] folder, run `npm install` then `node server`
- Your console should now be indicating "Listening on port 3000 - Connected to MongoDB"

- From the [root] folder, run `npm install` then `ng serve`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
- Make sure the password you choose to register is strong (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character)
